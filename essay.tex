\section{Sensoji Temple}

Sneaking into the shadows of crowds, I find there is no space. The Sensoji street demonstrates its prosperity under the flaming sky. From all directions, people are standing under the spotlight, holding hands with those closest to them. Drearily, it’s not so long until the heat melts me into the crowd, flowing down to the center of the street with those I’m not a part of. 

The Sensoji temple sits right at the end of the street, hiding behind the shadow of the clouds. But, from where I’m standing, shops fill up the sides of the pedestrian mall. People are pushing me forward. In the milky way of crowds that I’m in, various people are heading to the front.  

The air is humid in the crowds, and although the cool wind blows by, beads of sweat still drip off blushed cheeks. Suffering, adrift with the flow into the street center. While I’m unbuckling the buttons, trying to get some cool wind in, I find myself in a circle of maidens, who are dressed in stunningly ornate clothes and adorned with fabric jewels. Nevertheless, the maiden’s high-pitched giggle and teasing of each other have drowned out any other sounds. Whenever they stop, there is always a higher pitch sound rushing out of their mouth and getting louder and higher and louder and higher and louder and higher.  
  
Finally, cast off those maidens at a crossroads, I can feel the autumn wind again. Standing away from the street center, nearby a store, a young couple sits hand-in-hand. As a flicker of hair hangs in front of her face, the man gently caresses it back behind her ear. He softly strokes her cheek and moves his mouth to say something. It is surely something beautiful because a bashful grin appears on the young woman’s face. She unpacks her little bag and reaches her phone high up in the sky. The couple both laugh radiantly at the camera, recording this special moment. 

Wandering in the square with the crowds, now the side of the street seems apparent. Moving past the shops, away from the central street, the traditional buildings remind me of the history hundreds of years ago. Dreamily, reaching out my arms, enjoying the blow of chilly wind in the early autumn. Trees are flamed, reflecting the fire-like shadow on the store’s roofs and the temple, decorating the simple white walls with the comeliness of nature. The wind blows through the trees, knocking down two or three cherry-colored leaves. I stand below the trees and see a man walking purposely yet carefully down to the temple. He has a black bun on top of his head, pointing straight to the sky. Seeing a fan slightly waving in his hands, my sight follows him into the temple gate.   

Suddenly, someone bumps into me and breaks my illusion. A man in a shirt rushing by, he is still on his phone while he dashes up the street. Papers soar out of his briefcase and get caught by the wind, traveling to an unknown place on this street. Passers pass by, not giving a glance at the young adult. 

He stands dumbfounded, the phone is still ringing, indistinct voices can be heard: “…what’re…you thinking…you…here, now.” The group of maidens meets again at this crossroad, teasing and giggling again to what they have seen or done. They ignore the man, too. The man stoops down trembling and picks up the papers that are in his sight. His shirt is translucent because of the cold sweat, I can nearly see his slender limbs shiver. Zipping up my coat, turning my head the other way, I move directly towards the temple.  

At the end of the street, sits the fedora-like building. The Sensoji Temple reaps my sight. From the outside, white, red, and black intricate patterns complete the austere gate-door. The crowd bottleneck and thrust through the austere gates. They never raise their heads to admire the flowery fractal upon them. It’s only a line of black hair before the gate that others can see. 

Under the late evening light, scarlet pillars with dark bricks become iridescent. A gigantic lantern hangs below the ceiling of the major door, slightly swinging on the hanger, giving out weak yellow light. As the bottleneck is released, the crowd separates. Near the temples, but not in them, people are cleaning their hands at the Mitarai. Clear cool liquid flows down from the hishaku—a roughened ladle—and drips down, delicately. The droplets of water sparkle when cascading, taking away any impurities. 
  
Turning around. A dark blue line replaces the rosy line on the horizon. The crowded river slowly fades away and the modern streets appear. In this modern city, skyscrapers stand like bounding walls around the temple. 
  
My heart bumps.
